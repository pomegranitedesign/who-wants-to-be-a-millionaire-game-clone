## Description
You have been asked to develop a script that mimics the famous tv show called **“Who wants to be a Millionaire”**

## Rules
The game must firstly capture the player entire name and then the player will be asked a series of questions, broken up into 3 distinct rounds. For each question, the player must choose the correct  answer from  four (4) possible answer choices provided.

## General Rules
1. For each question, the game must randomly select a question from a bank of questions. Note, any question generated cannot be repeated throughout the duration of the game.

2. Please note, in round 2 and round 3, a player will be eligible to use  two (2) “Call a Friend” lifelines. If the player decides to use this on any question, in round 2 and/or round 3, the game will eliminate two incorrect answers, thus making it easier for the player to guess the answer.

3. Once the player incorrectly answers a question, he or she will automatically lose the game and  will “walk away” with no money.
